# BIOMECHANICS
For those going into biomechanics that want some help with the coding

Cycles through pictures in a folder or frames of a video (both present in code)
in order to collectpositional data of markers on samples being tested for stress 
and strain. 

Published MATlab code. 

Conversion factors can be calculated using imtool. 

Determine Crop parameters using imcrop. Crop considering the amount the sample 
will stretch, but get rid of as much background and setup materials in the frame 
as possible helps eliminate need for further image processing.

Take videos using set up pictured with a white background.

Hexbug Motion Analysis will be up soon. Similar concept in code. Currently has a
bug where while loops aren't ending and must be manually closed to collect the data. 

GOOD LUCK. Ochia will teach you nothing, Jon will teach you a lot.
